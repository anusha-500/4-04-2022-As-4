    <h1>Question-9</h1>
    <h2>this is local storage.</h2>
    <p>I am explaining about local storage and session storage</p>
    <p> The main features of local storage are:</p>
    <p>Shared between all tabs -> Windows from the same origin</p>
    <p>->The data does not expire .it remains after the browser restart and even os rebout</p>
    <p>ex:localstorage.set-item(test,1);</p>
    <p>just open the same page on a different window then you get like this page.</p>
    <p>alert(localstorage.getitem('test1));</p>
    <h2>this is session storage</h2>
    <p>this object is used much less often than local storage</p>
    <p>the session storage exists only with in the current browser tab </p>
    <p>another tab with with the same page will have a different storage</p>
    <p>but it is shared between iframes in the same tab</p>
    <p>the data survies page refresh,but not closingor opening the tab.</p>
    <p>ex:session storage.setitem('test,1);</p>
    <p>alert(session storage.getitem(test1);</p>
